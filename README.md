# FT-Assessment

A simple front-end application I built for a coding assessment using React, TypeScript and the [COVID-19 States API](https://disease.sh/docs/#/COVID-19%3A%20Worldometers/get_v3_covid_19_states) that pulls up to date information about the 50 states and other US territories' COVID-19 statistics
